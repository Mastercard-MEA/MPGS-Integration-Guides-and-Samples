## Disclaimer
The following <ins>unofficial</ins> guide contains a simplified explanation of MPGS. This guide is by no means an exhaustive one and only represents a scenario where the merchant is enabled to use some of the most common features of the Gateway. Additional features may need to be configured separately. Samples are examples for reference only, while configuring your actual live merchants on the platform, always consider the risk and financial impact, as well as your policies and scheme and local rule and regulation. Follow this guide at your own responsibility, and make sure to read [the full guide here](https://ap-gateway.mastercard.com/api/documentation/integrationGuidelines/index.html?locale=en_US).
